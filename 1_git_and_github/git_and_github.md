# Complete GitHub & Git Mastery

## 1. Introduction to Version Control

### What is Version Control?
Version control is like having a **time machine for your code**. Imagine you're writing a story and you want to:
- Save different drafts
- Go back to previous versions
- Work with co-authors without stepping on each other's toes
- Keep track of who changed what and when

That's exactly what version control does for software development!

### Git vs GitHub: The Dynamic Duo

**Git** 🔧
- The **tool** (software you install on your computer)
- Tracks changes locally on your machine
- Works offline
- Like having a personal diary

**GitHub** 🌐
- The **platform** (website/service)
- Stores your code online
- Enables collaboration
- Like sharing your diary with the world (but organized!)

### Real-World Analogy
Think of Git as your personal notebook where you jot down ideas, and GitHub as the library where you store and share these notebooks with others.

## 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Installing Git

**Windows:**
```bash
# Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
# Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew:
brew install git

# Or download from: https://git-scm.com/download/mac
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### Creating Your GitHub Account
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Choose a username (this will be part of your professional identity!)
4. Use a professional email address

### Initial Git Configuration
```bash
# Set your identity (use your GitHub email!)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Set default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Check your configuration
git config --list
```

---

## 3. Git Fundamentals

### The Git Workflow: Three States
```
Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository
     (Modified)      (Staged)      (Committed)
```

### Creating Your First Repository

**Step 1: Initialize a Repository**
```bash
# Create a new project folder
mkdir my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project

# Initialize Git
git init
```

**Step 2: Check Status (Your Best Friend!)**
```bash
git status
```

**Step 3: Create and Add Files**
```bash
# Create a simple Python file
echo "print('Hello, Git!')" > hello.py

# Check status again
git status

# Add file to staging area
git add hello.py

# Add all files at once
git add .
```

**Step 4: Make Your First Commit**
```bash
git commit -m "Add initial Python hello script"
```

**Step 5: View Your History**
```bash
# Simple log
git log

# Pretty log
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

### Understanding .gitignore
Create a `.gitignore` file to tell Git which files to ignore:

```bash
# Create .gitignore
touch .gitignore
```

Common Python .gitignore entries:
```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.env
venv/
.vscode/
.DS_Store
```

## 4. Working with Repositories

### Local vs Remote Repositories

**Local Repository** 🏠
- Lives on your computer
- You have full control
- Can work offline

**Remote Repository** ☁️
- Lives on GitHub (or other platforms)
- Shared with team members
- Backup of your work

### Cloning an Existing Repository
```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git

# Clone and rename the folder
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git my-local-name
```

---

## 5. Branching & Merging Mastery

### Why Branches?
Branches are like **parallel universes** for your code:
- Main branch: stable, production-ready code
- Feature branches: experimental features
- Bug fix branches: isolated fixes

### Branch Commands

**Creating and Switching Branches**
```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature/user-authentication

# Switch to the branch
git checkout feature/user-authentication

# Create and switch in one command (modern way)
git switch -c feature/user-authentication

# List all branches
git branch
```

**Working with Branches**
```bash
# Make changes in your feature branch
echo "def authenticate_user(): pass" >> auth.py
git add auth.py
git commit -m "Add user authentication function"

# Switch back to main
git switch main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/user-authentication

# Delete the feature branch (cleanup)
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
```

---


**basic path to make a repo**
```bash
git init
git add .
git status
git commit -m "commit message"
git branch -m main
# git remote add origin https://github.com/FS-G/test_class.git - this is a one time command - only run when you make a new repo
git push origin main
```

## 6. GitHub Integration & VS Code Connection

### 🎯 Connecting VS Code to GitHub

**Step 1: Install GitHub Extension**
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues"
4. Install it

**Step 2: Sign in to GitHub**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "GitHub: Sign in"
3. Follow the authentication flow

**Step 3: Clone Repository in VS Code**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Git: Clone"
3. Enter GitHub repository URL
4. Select folder location

### Setting up Authentication with Personal Access Token (PAT)

**Why PAT?** GitHub requires secure authentication for pushing changes. Personal Access Tokens are more secure than passwords.

**Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token**
1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "VS Code Git Access")
4. Set expiration (recommended: 90 days)
5. Select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `write:packages`
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **Important:** Copy the token immediately - you won't see it again!

**Step 2: Configure Git with HTTPS and PAT**
```bash
# When you first try to push, Git will ask for credentials
git push

# Enter your GitHub username
# For password, paste your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password!)
```

**Step 3: Store Credentials (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
# Configure Git to remember credentials
git config --global credential.helper store

# Or for Windows users:
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

**Alternative: Using VS Code's Built-in Authentication**
- When you try to push from VS Code, it will automatically prompt you to authenticate
- Choose "Sign in with GitHub" for the easiest setup
- This handles PAT creation and storage automatically

### Connecting Local Repository to GitHub

**Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub**
1. Go to github.com
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it (same as your local folder)
4. **Don't** initialize with README if you already have local files

**Step 2: Connect Local to Remote**
```bash
# Add GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

# Verify the connection
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Working with Remote Repositories
```bash
# Push changes
git push

# Pull changes from remote (downloads AND merges automatically)
git pull

# Fetch changes (downloads but doesn't merge - safer option)
git fetch
```

**Difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`:**
- **`git pull`**: Downloads changes from remote AND automatically merges them into your current branch
- **`git fetch`**: Only downloads the changes but leaves them separate - you decide when to merge
- **Best Practice**: Use `git fetch` first to see what changed, then merge manually if everything looks good

## 7. Collaborative Development Activity

### 🎯 Class Collaboration Exercise: "Python Recipe Book"

**Objective:** Create a collaborative Python recipe book where each student contributes different recipes and cooking functions.

**Setup Phase (Instructor):**
```bash
# Instructor creates the main repository
mkdir python-recipe-book
cd python-recipe-book
git init

# Create main recipe file
cat > main.py << EOF
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Python Recipe Book - A Collaborative Cooking Project
"""

def main():
    print("🍳 Welcome to our Python Recipe Book! 🍳")
    print("Available recipes:")
    
    # Students will add their recipes here
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF

git add main.py
git commit -m "Initialize Python Recipe Book project"

# Push to GitHub (instructor creates the repo first)
git remote add origin https://github.com/instructor/python-recipe-book.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Student Activity (Each Student):**

**Phase 1: Fork and Clone**
1. Go to the instructor's repository
2. Click "Fork" to create your own copy
3. Clone YOUR fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-recipe-book.git
cd python-recipe-book
```

**Note:** If you have direct access to the original repository (i.e., you're added as a collaborator), you can skip the forking step and clone the original repository directly. You'll then be able to push your branches directly to the main repository without needing pull requests from a fork.

**Phase 2: Create Your Recipe Branch**
```bash
# Create a unique branch (use your name/initials)
git switch -c recipe/john-pasta-carbonara

# Or more generally:
git switch -c recipe/[your-name]-[dish-name]
```

**Phase 3: Add Your Recipe**
Create a new Python file for your recipe:

```python
# pasta_carbonara.py (example)
def make_pasta_carbonara():
    """
    Classic Italian Pasta Carbonara Recipe
    Created by: John Smith
    """
    ingredients = [
        "400g spaghetti",
        "200g pancetta or guanciale",
        "4 large egg yolks",
        "100g Pecorino Romano cheese",
        "Black pepper",
        "Salt"
    ]
    
    instructions = [
        "1. Boil salted water and cook spaghetti",
        "2. Fry pancetta until crispy",
        "3. Mix egg yolks with grated cheese",
        "4. Combine hot pasta with pancetta",
        "5. Add egg mixture off heat, stirring quickly",
        "6. Season with black pepper and serve immediately"
    ]
    
    return {
        "name": "Pasta Carbonara",
        "ingredients": ingredients,
        "instructions": instructions,
        "cooking_time": "20 minutes",
        "difficulty": "Medium"
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    recipe = make_pasta_carbonara()
    print(f"Recipe: {recipe['name']}")
    for ingredient in recipe['ingredients']:
        print(f"- {ingredient}")
```

**Phase 4: Update Main File**
Modify `main.py` to include your recipe:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Python Recipe Book - A Collaborative Cooking Project
"""

# Import your recipe (students add their imports)
from pasta_carbonara import make_pasta_carbonara  # Example import

def main():
    print("🍳 Welcome to our Python Recipe Book! 🍳")
    print("Available recipes:")
    
    # Students add their recipe calls here
    recipe = make_pasta_carbonara()  # Example call
    print(f"- {recipe['name']} (by John Smith)")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Phase 5: Commit and Push Your Changes**
```bash
# Add your files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add Pasta Carbonara recipe by John Smith

- Include ingredients list and instructions
- Add cooking time and difficulty rating
- Update main.py to display the recipe"

# Push your branch to YOUR fork
git push -u origin recipe/john-pasta-carbonara
```

**Phase 6: Create Pull Request**
1. Go to your GitHub fork
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Write a descriptive pull request message
4. Submit for review

**Instructor Merge Process:**
The instructor will merge pull requests, which will create **intentional merge conflicts** for learning purposes.

## 8. Handling Merge Conflicts

### Understanding Merge Conflicts

Conflicts occur when:
- Two people modify the same line of code
- Someone deletes a file while another person modifies it
- Git can't automatically determine which change to keep

### Conflict Resolution Activity

**Scenario:** Multiple students added recipes to the same section of `main.py`

**Conflict Example:**
```python
def main():
    print("🍳 Welcome to our Python Recipe Book! 🍳")
    print("Available recipes:")
    
<<<<<<< HEAD
    # Alice's recipe
    recipe = make_chocolate_cake()
    print(f"- {recipe['name']} (by Alice)")
=======
    # Bob's recipe  
    recipe = make_beef_stew()
    print(f"- {recipe['name']} (by Bob)")
>>>>>>> recipe/bob-beef-stew
```

**Resolution Steps:**
```bash
# Pull the latest changes to see conflicts
git pull origin main

# Open the conflicted file in VS Code
# VS Code will highlight conflicts with colors!

# Edit the file to include both recipes:
def main():
    print("🍳 Welcome to our Python Recipe Book! 🍳")
    print("Available recipes:")
    
    # Alice's recipe
    alice_recipe = make_chocolate_cake()
    print(f"- {alice_recipe['name']} (by Alice)")
    
    # Bob's recipe  
    bob_recipe = make_beef_stew()
    print(f"- {bob_recipe['name']} (by Bob)")

# Stage the resolved file
git add main.py

# Complete the merge
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict: include both Alice's and Bob's recipes"

# Push the resolution
git push
```

### Using VS Code for Conflict Resolution

VS Code provides excellent conflict resolution tools:
- **Accept Current Change**: Keep your version
- **Accept Incoming Change**: Keep their version  
- **Accept Both Changes**: Combine both versions
- **Compare Changes**: See side-by-side diff
